The LTA works with a camera and computer vision algorithms. Are we supposed to try to replicate this or are we supposed 
to create some kind of sensors that detect the lines.


There are a few simulators that already have the car sensors, can we use these or are we supposed to make the sensors from scratch

We are supposed to make a very simple simulation, with only a car and two lines representing the road.
The LTA should not be a progammed cammera, it should just be some kind of algorithm that detects a valid distance to the
lines on both sides of the car. The car shouldn't try to keep in the middle, it should just slightly turn the steering weel
when it gets to close to one of the sides.
Very simple car geometry, with maybe (x,y,teta).
Could make a timed simulation, with many different situations, straight lines,  slight curves, tight curves, intersections, etc..
Use an already existing library for turning the car mannualy, for just side to side on keyboard or complete joystick.
